        <h1>About Qala Art Gallery</h1>
        <p class="about-intro">
          Qala is devoted to the
          <strong>spirit of Nepali culture and community.</strong> Founded in
          2012 in Maitidevi, Kathmandu, Qala was envisioned as a space where art
          could
          <em>hold memory, ask questions, and build connections</em> across
          time, disciplines, and generations.
        </p>
        <p>
          We celebrate art that carries memory, movement, and meaning. Our focus
          is on work rooted in tradition yet alive with the present. At Qala,
          each exhibition is a conversation between the past and the possible,
          showcasing artists who reflect the richness of Nepal's visual language
          and the complexities of its <strong>changing identity.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Our programming spans exhibitions, workshops, and residencies that
          bring together emerging and established voices. We collaborate with
          artists, researchers, and cultural workers whose practices explore
          heritage, ecology, social change, and lived experience. From quiet
          drawings to large-scale installations, every project is approached
          with care and curiosity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Qala is more than a gallery. It is a gathering space for
          <strong>dialogue, reflection, and community.</strong> Here, art is not
          separate from life. It is a part of how we
          <strong>remember, resist, imagine, and create together.</strong>

          <h2>Founder's Vision</h2>
          <p>
            "I grew up surrounded by art, not always in galleries or textbooks,
            but in the colors of rituals, the carvings on old windows, the
            rhythm of everyday life in Kathmandu. Over time, I began to see how
            art isn't just something we look at;
            <strong>it's something we live.</strong> It holds our history, our
            beliefs, our questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            This gallery is my attempt to create a space where all of that can
            come together. A place where the quiet grace of traditional forms
            <strong>meets the bold restlessness of contemporary voices.</strong>
            In a world that often feels rushed and repetitive, I wanted to build
            a home for expression that's honest, reflective, and
            unapologetically human"
